thea2
=====

Minimal refactor of original thea2: https://github.com/vangelisv/thea
on purpose to release it as usable out-of-the-box SWI-Prolog pack.

Excerpt from https://github.com/vangelisv/thea/README.md:

---+ Thea2 : Prolog Modules for OWL2

A collection of modules for parsing and manipulating OWL2 ontologies
in Prolog. It is developed with SWI-Prolog in mind, but the goal is to
maximize portability with other prologs, such as Yap and XSB.

---++ Authors

This module is a continuation of Thea1, developed by VV.

Some of the code was developed by CJM
